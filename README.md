This was a project that allowed me to practice the skills I was learning in template engines (EJS), server-side programming (Node.js & Express), and working with NoSQL databases (MongoDB & Mongoose).

It is a simple to do list web app. Here are the basics of this very basic app:
1. Type in the input box at the bottom of the list and push the add button to add to the list.
2. Check the box next to an item to delete it.
3. Add a word to the end of the home page's url in order to create your own list. 
  For example: 
  The home page: https://stormy-ridge-96799.herokuapp.com/
  Your own list: https://stormy-ridge-96799.herokuapp.com/mylist
